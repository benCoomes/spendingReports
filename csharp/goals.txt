Create a budgeting and spend monitoring application that: 
* allows user to see financial transactions
** individual transactions
** summaries by category: total, percent of all spending
** overall summaries: income vs expenses
* categorizes transactions
** automatically by rules
** manually for remaining
** groups 'transfers': amounts that cancel each other out 
*** user must confirm or split if no rule specifying decision
** supports 'contains' matching
** manual resolution for unmatched



Use cases and commands:
* user adds rules: (regex, category) pairs
** > spemo addrule <matcher> <category>
* user imports csv files
** > spemo import <filepath>
* user categorizes uncategorized transactions
** > spemo group
* user views summaries by category over last month
** > spemo report <month>
* user views summaries by year
** > spemo report <year>
** user views summaries over time range
** > spemo report <startDate> <endDate>
